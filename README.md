# Advcte

(pronounced "**adv**o**c**a**te**" in noun form.)

## An Evolving Landscape

Electronic Health Records (EHR's) have risen in popularity in the last 10-15 years as professionals in medical, behavioral health, addiction treatment, and other fields have been under increasing pressure to modernize documentation standards while continuing to provide quality services to their clients. Several recent legislative measures have increased regulatory pressure, so the need for quality information systems has also increased. Providers have long been drowning in paperwork and unfortunately the swell of information needed to be collected and transmitted in these lines of work is only increasing.

## Reimagining the EHR

EHR solutions unfortunately have not kept up with the rising tide of documentation needs, and that's where Advcte comes in. Just like hard-working service providers advocate for the needs of vulnerable children, families, and all patients alike: Advcte is here to finally meet the needs of service providers.

The are plenty of system out there that were on the forefront of innovative technology at the dawn of electronic health records, but many of these systems are now outdated. Some are built to still run only on Internet Explorer 11 and other aging internet standards, which makes the user experience generally terrible. And on top of that, most solutions don't work with mobile platforms that well, or offer mobile versions separately (for an additional cost).

Advcte is primarily built with **JavaScript/ECMAScript 2018**, Meta's **React** JavaScript library, and **Bootstrap 5 _(with Popper)_** - a front-end design framework. Advcte was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). The result is a fast, responsive user experience that provides a clean and easy-to-use interface. Plus, Advcte works on mobile devices (even your smartphone) out of the box. No additional costs or hidden fees.

## Explore Advcte

Currently Advte is in _development_. It was created by Rimezin as a concept for a better electronic health record solution. Advcte is open-source (and open for suggestions/improvement ideas). If you'd like to contribute, send me a message.
